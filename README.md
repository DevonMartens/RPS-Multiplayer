# RPS-Multiplayer

This repository contains my homework for Georgia Institute of Technology's coding boot camp for Unit 7.

Langues used: JQuery, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, Firebase.

This game uses JQuery to play rock, paper, scissors and Firebase to make the game multiplayer. In addition, there is a chat segment that allows each player to communicate with one another through out the game. 

The Game:
JQuery builds all basic apsects of the RPS game by keeping count of wins and losses, allowing a player to select thier move, who's turn, assigning a player number, tracking the choice of each player. All  this information is stored in an object. Functions allow the players to play.

Firebase is used to ensure only two players can enter the came at once. In addition firebase severs as the connection between the players. Allowing thier data to be shared with one another and communication to work between players.
